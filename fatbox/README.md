# Fault analysis toolbox - tutorials

![alt text](https://github.com/thilowrona/fault_analysis_toolbox/blob/master/fault_network.png)

This is the companion repository to the [fault analysis toolbox](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox) containing a series of tutorials. You can also find documentation [here](https://fatbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Numerical models
First, we will look at fault analyses in numerical models. One of the easiest ways of getting started is with Jupyter notebooks - an awesome combination of code, documentation and output. The easiest way is to run them with Google Colab, so you don't need any special hardware or software. Just try it out:

### [Tutorial A1: Fault extraction from numerical model](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Numerical_models/1-fault_extraction/1-fault_extraction.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to extract a fault network from a 2-D slice of a numerical model

### [Tutorial A2: Fault properties](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Numerical_models/2-fault_properties/2-fault_properties.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to calculate the strike and length of the extracted faults

### [Tutorial A3: Time stepping](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Numerical_models/3-time_stepping/3-time_stepping.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to track fault networks through time in numerical models

### [Tutorial A4: Fault slip](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Numerical_models/4-fault_slip/4-fault_slip.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to calculate fault slip from numerical models

### [Tutorial A5: Displacement](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Numerical_models/5-displacement/5-displacement.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to sum up fault slip to displacement through time

### [Tutorial A6: Fault evolution](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Numerical_models/6-evolution/6-evolution.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to visualize the evolution of our faults with time

## Analog models

## Digital elevation models
### [Tutorial C1: Fault extraction from digital elevation model (DEM)](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Digital_elevation_models/Fault_extraction_La_Rosa.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to extract a fault network from a DEM

## Seismic reflection data
### [Tutorial D1: Fault extraction from seismic attribute map](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Seismic_data/Seismic_fault_extraction.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to extract a fault network from seismic attribute map



### Extra tutorials
### [Tutorial E1](https://github.com/thilowrona/fatbox_tutorials/blob/main/Extra/E3-parallel.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to extract faults in parallel
